# rest-dumper
This is a program the uses the F5-SDK Python module to dump config onto BIG-IP. 
It is slow and not refactored. It is not usefule to cofnig a BIG-IP but more to test the REST API and use later to see how to make basic objects.


There needs to be an include folder in directory where run from and place the following file in it:

$ ls -lrt
